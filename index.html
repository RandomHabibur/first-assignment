            <p>My Beloved Bangladesh district Sylhet  is experiencing one of the worst floods in history.
             Almost 80% of the whole Sylhet is affected by this flood . Many people lost their homes; many people did not find any shelter or even essential foods and electricity are not available due to the flood. So we stand with Sylhet. If you want to help them please donate.</p><br>
